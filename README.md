This project is an implementation of a webcam-screen communication in one way. A text is encoded into colors which are displayed sequencially on the screen, and a decoder (threaded_decoding) decodes it. This project is done in the context of the EPFL course "Principle of Digital Communication", given by Pr. Emre Telatar.

image_creation file starts the process from emitter side and threaded_decoding starts process from receiver side
